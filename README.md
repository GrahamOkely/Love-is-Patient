Song about love

I wrote this song in 1988 to teach the various aspects of love.
Usually these words (1 Corinthians 13:4-8) are spoken at weddings but I wanted to give them more visability.
So I wrote this tune, which is supposed to be a bright happy style, to help them remember it.

Please use it. The music copyright is mine and the words are taken from the Bible.

The plan is to have a separate page for each language and to have as many languages as we can!
